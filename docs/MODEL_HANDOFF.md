# ML Model Handoff Architecture

## Principles

- All models must be evaluated against strict memory bounds (`< 200MB` peak during inference) to ensure stable background operations.
- Inter-layer communication for model tracking should be heavily decoupled and dependency injected.
- Any model addition or swap requires updating this document with new benchmark results.

## Task Tracking

- **Completed:** S001 + S001B + S002 + S003/A/B/H (Export Studio, UI Polish, Icon Pack).
- **Active:** S004 (Editing Pack A) — Speed, Aspect Ratio, Watermark (free-tier).

## Environment Identity

- **Local Path:** `C:\Users\pc\Documents\GitHub\VideoEditor\lumacraft_mobile`
