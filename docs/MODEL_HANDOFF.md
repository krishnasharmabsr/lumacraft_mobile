# ML Model Handoff Architecture

## Principles

- All models must be evaluated against strict memory bounds (`< 200MB` peak during inference) to ensure stable background operations.
- Inter-layer communication for model tracking should be heavily decoupled and dependency injected.
- Any model addition or swap requires updating this document with new benchmark results.

## Task Tracking

- **Completed:** S001 + S001B + S002 + S003/A/B/H + S004 + S004A/B/C/D/E (Export Hotfix/UX/Stability).
- **Active:** S005 (Video AI Generation Foundation)
