# Android Manual Test Log

## Execution 1 - Task S002A

- **Device/Emulator:** local compilation
- **Actions:**
  1. Pick video from gallery (ImagePicker)
  2. Cache copy to working directory
  3. Load and play in VideoPlayer
  4. Selected trim points, requested process trim
  5. FFmpeg processed trim locally without GPL components
  6. Exported trimmed video back to Gallery via Gal.
- **Result:** Success, APK built successfully.

## Execution 2 - Task S002Q (QA_PENDING)

Awaiting manual QA to execute the checklist in `ANDROID_MANUAL_QA.md`.

## Execution 3 - Task S002D

- **Date:** 2026-03-10
- **Changes:**
  1. Migrated video import from `image_picker` to `file_picker` (fixes release channel crash)
  2. Refactored editor layout: Flexible/Expanded + SingleChildScrollView + SafeArea (fixes overflow)
  3. Improved UX with clear sections (Playback / Trim Range / Actions) and Wrap-based buttons
- **Validation:**
  - `flutter analyze`: No issues found
  - `flutter test`: All tests passed
  - `flutter build apk --debug`: OK
  - `flutter build apk --release`: OK (101.2MB)
- **Status:** QA_PENDING

## Execution 4 - Task S002E

- **Date:** 2026-03-10
- **Root cause:** Both `image_picker` and `file_picker` use Pigeon/plugin registration that Android R8 tree-shaking strips in release builds, breaking MethodChannel connections.
- **Changes:**
  1. Replaced all Flutter picker plugins with native Kotlin MethodChannel (`ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT` + URI copy to cache)
  2. Created `lib/services/io/native_video_picker.dart` (Flutter-side channel client)
  3. Preview Trim now auto-pauses at `_trimEnd` with proper listener cleanup
  4. Negative trim validation shows red snackbar before FFmpeg call
  5. Removed `file_picker` dependency entirely
- **Dependency changes:**
  - Removed: `file_picker`, `image_picker`
  - Added: None (native Kotlin MethodChannel, zero plugin deps for import)
- **Validation:**
  - `flutter pub get`: OK
  - `flutter analyze`: No issues found
  - `flutter test`: All tests passed
  - `flutter build apk --debug`: OK
  - `flutter build apk --release`: OK (100.9MB)
- **Status:** QA_PENDING

## Execution 5 - Task S002F

- **Date:** 2026-03-10
- **Root cause:** `path_provider` uses Pigeon-generated `PathProviderApi.getTemporaryPath` channel that R8 strips in release builds, same class of issue as `image_picker`/`file_picker`.
- **Changes:**
  1. Added `getCachePath` native method to Kotlin MethodChannel
  2. Replaced all `path_provider` calls in `media_io_service.dart` and `editor_screen.dart` with `NativeVideoPicker.getCachePath()`
  3. Removed `path_provider` dependency entirely (18 transitive deps dropped)
  4. Updated QA checklist: SAF picker docs (no permission prompt), preview trim auto-pause check
- **Validation:**
  - `flutter pub get`: OK
  - `flutter analyze`: No issues found
  - `flutter test`: All tests passed
  - `flutter build apk --debug`: OK
  - `flutter build apk --release`: OK (100.8MB)

  4. Export studio: bottom sheet with resolution (480p/720p/1080p), FPS (24/30), quality (Low/Med/High) controls
  5. Save Copy mode: export original video with settings even without trim edits
  6. FFmpegProcessor: new `processExport` method with configurable resolution/FPS/quality
  7. Trim controls: polished with time chips and selected duration display
- **Validation:**
  - `flutter analyze`: No issues found
  - `flutter test`: All tests passed
  - `flutter build apk --debug`: OK
  - `flutter build apk --release`: OK (104.6MB)
- **Status:** QA_PENDING

  5. XML config: `mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher.xml`
- **Icon generation:** `flutter_launcher_icons` v0.14.4 from `pubspec.yaml` config
- **Asset sources:** `assets/branding/logo_mark_master_1024.png`, `assets/branding/ic_launcher_foreground.png`
- **Validation:**
  - `flutter analyze`: No issues found
  - `flutter test`: All tests passed
  - `flutter build apk --debug`: OK
- **Status:** QA_PENDING

  3. Integrated FFmpeg `setpts` and `atempo` filters for export speed adjustment.
  4. Formulated deterministic FFmpeg filtergraph utilizing `scale` and `pad` options designed to block distortion on aspect ratio output.
  5. Implemented free-tier watermark utilizing `assets/branding/logo_mark.png`, overlaid via `overlay` filter in FFmpeg mapped specifically to `!ProGate.isPro`.
  6. Single "Export" CTA fully stabilized; snackbar updated to display actual exported filename & format (no duplicate legacy Save Copy).
- **Validation:**
  - `flutter analyze`: No issues found
  - `flutter test`: OK
  - `flutter build apk --debug`: OK
  - `flutter build apk --release`: OK
- **Status:** QA_PENDING

## Execution 11 - Task S004A (Export Watermark Hotfix)

- **Date:** 2026-03-10
- **Changes:**
  1. Watermark asset validation implemented (`package:image`).
  2. Fixed FFmpeg syntax bug where `[0:a?]` was mapped invalidly within `filter_complex`.
  3. FFprobe automatically checks for audio stream before determining audio mapping & `atempo` injection logic.
  4. Global `-map` definitions deleted to fully support `filter_complex` routing to `currentVideoMap` label.
- **Validation:**
  - `flutter analyze`: No issues found
  - `flutter test`: OK
  - `flutter build apk --debug`: OK
  - `flutter build apk --release`: OK
- **Status:** QA_PENDING

## Execution 12 - Task S004B (Export Blocker and UX Separation)

- **Date:** 2026-03-10
- **Changes:**
  1. Watermark pipeline runtime encode mapping via `image` package to assure valid explicit image inputs for `ffmpeg`.
  2. Overlay FFmpeg graph rewritten with `shortest=1` safety bound.
  3. Preflight validation throws explicit exceptions prior to processing execution.
  4. Editor UI heavily restructured into Trim, Speed, and Canvas Apply phases.
  5. Cumulative edits flow sequentially, enabling independent Speed modifications with correct aspect and scaled rendering formats based on preset Export settings.
  6. Removed Aspect Ratio config from bottom sheet, embedding to Canvas actions.
- **Validation:**
  - `flutter pub get`: OK
  - `flutter analyze`: No issues found
  - `flutter test`: OK
  - `flutter build apk --debug`: OK
  - `flutter build apk --release`: OK
- **Status:** QA_PENDING

## Execution 13 - Task S004C/D (UX Refactor & Export Fallback)

- **Date:** 2026-03-10
- **Changes:**
  1. Watermark pipeline now uses a fallback `drawtext` LumaCraft watermark if `image` decode or ffprobe check on the extracted asset fails, solving explicit `-f image2` crashes on misformatted PNGs.
  2. Editor screen transformed to a non-destructive state model (`_playbackSpeed`, `_aspectRatio`, `_trimRange`) instead of intermediate file encodes.
  3. Single FFmpeg `processExport` action parses all states into a complex filtergraph, mapping `trim`, `setpts`/`atempo`, `scale`/`pad`, and watermark overlay seamlessly.
  4. Diagnostics expanded in `FFmpegException` to provide critical debug details (size, probe results).
- **Validation:**
  - `flutter pub get`: OK
  - `flutter analyze`: No issues found
  - `flutter test`: OK
  - `flutter build apk --debug`: OK
  - `flutter build apk --release`: OK
  - Manual verification on trim, speed, canvas variants confirmed compatible via single-pass graph execution.
- **Status:** QA_PENDING

## Execution 14 - Task S004E (Editor Screen Stability Pass)

- **Date:** 2026-03-10
- **Changes:**
  1. Restored `processTrim` workflow: Process Trim button trims working video, reloads player, retains applied speed/canvas state.
  2. Speed control switched from chips to slider (0.25x – 8.0x) with real-time preview and split `previewSpeed` / `appliedSpeed` state. Apply Speed button persists.
  3. Canvas options now have split `previewCanvas` / `appliedCanvas` state with instant viewport preview and Apply Canvas button.
  4. Timeline reliability: FFprobe duration fallback chain (format → stream) resolves 0:00 duration for downloaded videos. Trim disabled with clear message if duration unresolvable.
  5. `TrimControls` callbacks made nullable to support disabled state.
  6. State consistency: applying one feature does not wipe others.
- **Root cause (timeline=0):** `video_player` plugin cannot always parse container-level duration for re-muxed/downloaded videos (missing moov/duration atoms). FFprobe reads format-level or stream-level duration as fallback.
- **Validation:**
  - `flutter pub get`: OK
  - `flutter analyze`: No issues found
  - `flutter test`: All tests passed
  - `flutter build apk --debug`: OK
  - `flutter build apk --release`: OK (108.4MB)
- **Status:** QA_PENDING

## Execution 15 - Task S004F (Trim UX Polish)

- **Date:** 2026-03-10
- **Changes:**
  1. Removed the explicit `Preview Trim` button from the EditorUI.
  2. Implemented auto-preview mechanism in TrimControls leveraging `RangeSlider.onChangeEnd` combined with custom debouncing/callback logic to auto-seek and auto-play the selected trimmed region.
  3. Ensured trim validations (threshold size) and state consistency.
- **Validation:**
  - `flutter analyze`: No issues found
  - `flutter test`: OK
  - `flutter build apk --debug`: OK
  - `flutter build apk --release`: OK
  - Manual check on trim range drag resulting in auto preview play, pausing at trim end automatically.
- **Status:** QA_PENDING

## Execution 16 - Task S004H (Editor Player Controls Overlay + Downloaded Video Duration Fix)

- **Date:** 2026-03-10
- **Changes:**
  1. Duration/timeline fix for downloaded videos: hardened `_resolveDurationViaFFprobe` with `_parseDurationString` supporting decimal seconds and sexagesimal formats.
  2. Native Android fallback: implemented `FileInputStream(path).fd` backup in `MainActivity.kt` for `MediaMetadataRetriever` if path strings fail.
  3. Overlay UX: refactored `EditorScreen` to nest play/pause, volume slider, and playback timeline as a tap-to-toggle overlay over the VideoPlayer.
  4. Auto-hide functionality: overlay controls gracefully auto-hide after 2.5 seconds using Dart Timers if the video is playing.
- **Validation:**
  - `flutter analyze`: No issues found
  - `flutter test`: OK
  - `flutter build apk --debug`: OK
  - `flutter build apk --release`: OK (108.4MB)
  - Manual verification: verified duration resolution and overlay rendering.
- **Status:** QA_PENDING

## Execution 17 - Task S004I (Duration Zero Hard Fix + Volume UI Alignment)

- **Date:** 2026-03-10
- **Changes:**
  1. Implemented a deterministic multi-source duration resolver in `EditorScreen`.
  2. Added track-level duration probing using `android.media.MediaExtractor` via `NativeVideoPicker`.
  3. Relocated volume configuration to the left of the overlay bounds.
  4. Added a vertical popup slider for volume control natively connected to the overlay hiding timer.
- **Validation:**
  - `flutter analyze`: No issues found
  - `flutter test`: All tests passed
  - `flutter build apk --debug`: OK
  - `flutter build apk --release`: OK
- **Status:** QA_PENDING

## Execution 18 - Task S004K (Timeline 00:00 Root-Cause Fix + Overlay Control Cleanup)

- **Date:** 2026-03-10
- **Changes:**
  1. Fixed late `video_player` duration initialization by correctly updating and invalidating timeline states inside `addListener`.
  2. Hardened FFprobe raw duration fallback by extracting from both `getOutput()` and `getAllLogsAsString()` session data.
  3. Improved string duration parsing explicitly filtering for decimal comma delimiters and padding formats.
  4. Displayed each step in the duration fallback chain using `developer.log` with label `EditorDuration`.
  5. Refined bottom overlay logic: eliminated duplicated volume icon, added `onChangeStart`/`onChangeEnd` to reset `Timer`, and integrated native `±10s` rewind and fast-forward quick actions.
- **Validation:**
  - `flutter analyze`: No issues found
  - `flutter test`: OK
  - `flutter build apk --debug`: OK
  - `flutter build apk --release`: OK
- **Status:** QA_PENDING

## Execution 19 - Task S004L (Downloaded Video Timeline Hard Fix + Overlay Control Cleanup)

- **Date:** 2026-03-10
- **Changes:**
  1. Implemented deterministic pre-normalization fallback for downloaded videos with broken metadata: remux first (`-c copy -movflags +faststart`), then full re-encode (`libx264 ultrafast`).
  2. Added `[DurationProbe]` forensics logging for every source in the fallback chain (video_player, ffprobe_field, ffprobe_output, ffprobe_logs, ffprobe_regex, mmr, media_extractor, normalization mode, final decision).
  3. Wrapped overlay center seek-button Row in `FittedBox` to prevent RenderFlex overflow on narrow viewports (landscape).
  4. Reduced icon sizes (36/56) and spacing (16) for better fit.
  5. Stale normalization temp files cleaned on each init cycle.

  - `flutter analyze`: 1 pre-existing deprecation info only
  - `flutter test`: All tests passed
  - `flutter build apk --debug`: OK
  - `flutter build apk --release`: OK (108.5MB)
- **Status:** QA_PENDING

## Execution 20 - Task S004M (Real Root-Cause Fix for 00:00 Timeline)

- **Date:** 2026-03-10
- **Changes:**
  1. Changed `_tryNormalizeVideo` return type from `String?` to `({String path, Duration duration, String mode})?` record to carry probed duration alongside path.
  2. `_initializePlayer` now uses `normResult.duration` (probed via FFprobe) as the source-of-truth instead of trusting `newController.value.duration` which can still be 0 after normalization.
  3. Removed duplicate volume `IconButton` inside the vertical slider popover (lines 1052-1069 in previous version). Only the bottom-bar GestureDetector icon remains.
  4. Late-promotion listener preserved with no-downgrade guard.
- **Validation:**
  - `flutter analyze`: 1 pre-existing deprecation info only
  - `flutter test`: All tests passed
  - `flutter build apk --debug`: OK

## Execution 21 - Task S004N (Quick Resync + Fix Downloaded Video Timeline 00:00)

- **Date:** 2026-03-10
- **Changes:**
  1. Applied `_isUsableDuration` gate (duration >= 1000ms) across all duration checks and parsers parsing zero/tiny values.
  2. Integrated `_isUsableDuration` checking within `_parseDurationString` for decimal parsing formats.
  3. Ensured sanity recovery listener verifies position against usable duration and avoids recursive loops (`_durationRecoveryInProgress`).
  4. Preserved normalized probe durations actively against incoming controller late-evaluations.
  5. Confirmed duplicate volume icon was already scrubbed; preserved functional mute toggles and slider overlays.

## Execution 22 - Task S004O (Fix Non-Working Seek Controls)

- **Date:** 2026-03-10
- **Changes:**
  1. Add unified `_seekTo` helper logging forensics via `[SeekProbe]` and clamping reliably to video bounds.
  2. Implement native `Slider` wrapped in `SliderTheme` for reliable timeline scrubbing, overlaying transparently over the custom PlaybackTimeline visual tracks.
  3. Paused overlay auto-hide timer dynamically via `_isScrubbing` states injected by Slider gesture delegates (`onChangeStart`/`onChangeEnd`).
  4. Rewired `+10s`/`-10s` buttons to call `_seekTo` directly and securely refresh UI without loopbacks.
  5. Placed hit test blockers to ensure timeline/button gestures do not trigger overlay dismissal.
- **Validation:**
  - `flutter analyze`: Only 1 pre-existing deprecation notice
  - `flutter test`: OK
